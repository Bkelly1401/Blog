        <p>As a consumer the mousepad market is nonsensical, when companies use terms like "smooth glide" and "moderate friction" it doesn't really communicate anything. <br></br> How do you know if the "smooth glide" will feel smooth to you? <br>How do you know if "moderate surface friction" has the control you want?</p>
        <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <p>For a while the best way to find a mousepad you like has been to talk to others and compare, companies love this because it means they sell products regardless of if they fit you, and you the consumer end up with multiple pads that don't suit your needs while they hit their profit margins.</p>
        <h2>But this is outdated</h2>
        <p>For a while now in enthusiast circles we have been able to measure the speed of mousepads using physics, it is scientifically possible to know if a mousepad will fit you as soon as you have a reference mousepad and we do so using the following.</p>
        <h2>Static friction vs dynamic friction</h2>
        <p>In the most basic form think of static friction as control, and think of kinetic friction as glide following the bellow chart</p>

        <p>But let's elaborate, because in reality the more friction the slower the mousepad, more static friction will keep you at a standstill until you provide more force, while more kinetic friction will mean that you are fighting your mousepad to move, and inversely too little static will mean you have a harder time stopping on a target without undershooting during for example microadjustments, and too little kinetic will end up with your mouse flying around uncontrollably making it hard to track targets without overshooting.</p>
        <P>The general rule of thumb I would advise is to focus on static friction, find a comfortable controllable range and then experiment with different glide speeds.</P>
