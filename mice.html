                Finding A Mouse That Fits
            </h1>
            <p>
                Gaming mice have evolved dramatically in recent years with industry wide adoption of wireless, reduction of weight, and constant improvements made to sensor technology and polling rates. <br> But finding the perfect mouse hasn't gotten any easier.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                There is a big misconception in the gaming community, that copying professional players will lead to success, when in reality it is easy to be misled and end up buying a mouse that doesn't work for you.
            </p>
        
            <p>
               Thanks to <a href="https://prosettings.net/guides/gaming-mouse/" target="_blank">Prosettings.net</a> we can see that a staggering 33% of pro players use the G Pro X Superlight. <br> An incredible mouse<br> For claw grip—the most common style, the G pro lacks ergonomics due to it's ambidextrous design. <br> </br> Having a front-raised hump elevates the fingers and shifts the palm lower, reducing stability and control. <br> In contrast, the XM1R, a mouse designed for claw grip features a rear-centered hump, and drops down flatter at the front allowing you to arch your fingers more comfortably, check out <a href="https://www.eloshapes.com/mouse/compare?p=logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-vs.-endgame-gear-xm1r" target="_blank">Eloshapes.com</a> for a visual comparison. <br> </br> This isn't to say that the G Pro is a bad choice, it might even be perfect for you, at MinMaxMagic our goal is to help you make the right choice by using our enthusiast-level research.

            <h2>Finding A Gaming Mouse That Fits You</h2>
            <h3>The 3 most important considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grip Style</strong>: Consider how you hold your mouse—whether your style is claw, palm, fingertip, or a unique hybrid style, you should aim for a mouse that supports your natural points of contact, it should feel like an extension of your hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Mouse Size</strong>: Consider the width and length of your hand—measuring length from the underneath of your palm to the tip of your longest finger, and measuring width from one side to the other excluding your thumb, a mouse that sizes well against your hand will impact comfort and control.</li>
                <li><strong>Mouse Weight</strong>: Consider your preference—there is a lot of misinformation around this topic, and a trend of lighter = better, the ideal weight depends on your own comfort, and it is only recommended that you focus on lower weight if you are a fingertip gripper due to the lack of palm contact.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                By focusing on these factors, we will help you find the mouse shape that suits you best. So let's elaborate.
