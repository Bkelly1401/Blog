                In the last decade gaming mice have evolved dramatically due to industry wide adoption of wireless, reduction of weight, and constant improvements made to sensor technology and polling rates.

            <h2>
                But finding the perfect mouse hasn't gotten any easier.
            </h2>
            <h3>
                These are the top 3 reasons
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information</strong>: Enthusiasts coin new terminology and then it takes corporations years to adopt them, if you look on amazon you won't find a single mouse advertising grip style.</li>
                <li><strong>Brand Dominance</strong>: For a while big name brands were all that was available, now we have Pulsar, Lamzu, Egg, Ninjutso and many more accesible alternatives driving competition.</li> 
                <li><strong>Misconception</strong>: Copying the pro's, a lot of people seem to think this is the shortcut, but it is easy to be misled and end up buying a mouse that doesn't work for you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If we take a look over at <a href="https://prosettings.net/guides/gaming-mouse/" target="_blank">Prosettings.net</a> a staggering 33% of pro players use the G Pro X Superlight. <br> A top-tier ambidextrous mouse that was once the only choice, modernly however competition is fierce.

            <p>
                For claw grip—the most common grip, the G pro lacks in ergonomics due to it's neutral design. <br> Having a front-raised hump elevates the fingers and shifts the palm lower, reducing stability. 
            </p>
            <a><img src="images/mouse__comparison.svg" alt="Illustration of Logitech G Pro frontal curve"></a>
            <p>
                While mice designed for claw grip like the XM1R, may feature a rear-centered hump, that drops down flatter at the front allowing you to arch your fingers more comfortably.

            <h2>What Should I Look For In A Mouse?</h2>
            <h3>The 3 most important considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grip Style</strong>: Consider how you hold your mouse—whether your style is claw, palm, fingertip, or a unique hybrid style, you should aim for a mouse that supports your natural points of contact, it should feel like an extension of your hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Mouse Size</strong>: Consider the width and length of your hand—measuring length from the underneath of your palm to the tip of your longest finger, and measuring width from one side to the other excluding your thumb, a mouse that sizes well against your hand will impact comfort and control.</li>
                <li><strong>Mouse Weight</strong>: Consider your preference—there is a lot of misinformation around this topic, and a trend of lighter = better, the ideal weight depends on your own comfort, and it is only recommended that you focus on lower weight if you are a fingertip gripper due to the lack of palm contact.</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>How do I know which is which?</h1>
        <h2>Grip style</h2>
        <p>The 3 main styles are Palm, Claw, Fingertip, while a hybrid between these styles is the most common.</p>

        <h2>Mouse size / hand size</h2>
        <p>To measure your hand follow the illustration, and find out if your hands are small / medium / large.</p>
        <img src="">
        <p>Find any mouse you have currently, and google it's weight, the importance here is how you feel individually, not going as light as possible as is a trend currently. Some people will play better with higher weights due to the stability and control it offers, not everything is about reducing friction and throwing a mouse around, follow illustration for examples of mice that fit each style / size at differing weights as an example.</p>
