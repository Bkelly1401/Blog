This is a personal esports blog website I am creating to gain familiarity with the development process. 

Previously I have built a few websites using C# and ASP.Net at university, but this will be my first project where I code from scratch and use Javascript.

My plans for this project are to create an industry standard user experience(reactive / logical placement of elements) and to get familiar with layout design. Then as I learn more, I will implement better technology, such as React for the UI, JS to animate components, and Node for backend setup.

When I am satisfied I will deploy this website and move on to the next project which will be a dynamic website, hopefully data driven and with database connection so I can make use of the SQL I studied at university.
